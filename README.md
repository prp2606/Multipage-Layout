# Multipage-Layout
This is a MULTIPAGE LAYOUT, made using PUG as TEMPLATE ENGINE.

It is made up of 5 different web-pages that are interconnected and enabled with smooth page transitions and smooth scroll.
EXPRESS.JS is used for routing across pages and listening to the server.
All raw body code are written in PUG, which is later compiled as HTML and is very much used in writing REUSABLE HTML.
Concept of template inheritance is implemented for avoiding the workload of writing extra code.
Contact form is enabled to be fully functional.
Also, file-system and body-parser modules are used in order to take the data submitted from front-end and then it is dumped in our machine's local storage(ex: .txt files).

To make your own multipage website using this layout, just pull the repo on your local machine and edit the .pug files in the way you like.

#### NOTE 1 : Only desktop version of this layout is designed!
#### NOTE 2 : Upgraded version of this project coming soon!
